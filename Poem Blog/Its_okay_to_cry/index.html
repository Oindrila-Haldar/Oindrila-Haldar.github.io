            <h1>It's okay to cry</h1>
            <p>
                It's okay to cry <br>
                When there is too much on your mind.<br>
                Your mind brimming with the blues, <br>
                The clouds rain too.<br>
                When heavy things are lined up. <br><br>

                It's okay to cry.<br>
                A perfect way to detox.<br>
                But take a look at the wet tissues in the black box.<br>
                Laden with the past-rocks.<br>
                Like broken white chalks.<br>
                Broken and beautiful.<br>
                But carefully glance at them at last. <br>
                Soaked in your past.<br>
                Its gone, which means you have made it pretty fast.<br><br>

                It's okay to cry.<br>
                It maybe, out of all, the scariest,<br>
                But it definitely makes you the bravest,<br>
                To stare at an open book of facts.<br>
                And remember your most disgraceful acts.<br><br>

                It's okay to cry, <br>
                When the road ahead is bleak. <br>
                Or when you feel like an absolute freak,<br>
                And let your broken heart bleed.<br>
                Broken and beautiful.<br>
                It is the only way to cleanse your wound.<br>
                And get prepared to be recrowned.<br>
                And with the fading background, turn around.
