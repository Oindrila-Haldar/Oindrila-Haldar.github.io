                <h1>Metamorphosis</h1>
                <p><br>From slow dances and roses,<br>
                    To vows,<br>
                    To giggles, curls, ribbons and bows;<br>
                    Behold the little princess!<br><br>
    
                    From letter to words,<br>
                    Words building into sentences,<br>
                    To using these sentences to fool you,<br>
                    The bows turned into ruffles.<br><br>
                    
                    From learning to compute,<br>
                    To higher levels of abstraction,<br>
                    The dreams now bind my hands,<br>
                    The ribbons dried up as bands.<br><br>
                    
                    From skipping stones to bearing loads,<br>
                    From fairy tales to harsher codes,<br>
                    As innocence gives way to worldly ends,<br>
                    My giggles now hide an ocean of tears.<br>
                    Yet wisdom gained, shows wisdom still ahead.<br>
                    Grown up, I find Iâ€™m growing down instead,<br>
                    Caught in the tide of fears,  the weight of years.<br><br>
                    
                    From slow dances and roses,<br>
                    To vows,<br>
                    To giggles, curls, ribbons and bows,<br>
                    Behold the princess!<br>
                    The curls reappearing,<br>
                    On silver threads that mingle with the gold,<br>
                    The forgetful giggles and toothless stares,<br>
                    A heart that longs,<br>
                    For the princess in a queen, always finds a place.<br><br>
