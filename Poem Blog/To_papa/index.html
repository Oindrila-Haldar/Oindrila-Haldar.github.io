            To papa, <br>
            Hate not knowing what happens after death, <br>
            But love to believe that you live somewhere past heaven. <br>
            And someday again, when we meet,<br>
            I'll cry in you arms, <br>
            And again listen to your heartbeat.<br>
            And someday again, when we meet as father and daughter, <br>
            You'll wish I grow up and<br>
            I'll wish that we stay that way forever.<br>
            For had I the choice, to choose my father, <br>
            I'll choose you even in heaven<br>
            For even heaven is incomplete without you.<br>
