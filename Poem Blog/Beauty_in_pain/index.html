            <h1>Beauty in Pain</h1>
            <p>
                Life lies neither in reels nor in deals,<br>
                It is a life-long montage of how we feel, <br>
                With equal parts pain and pleasure.<br>
                Heart-warming memories we treasure,<br>
                For life ceases to exist but memories last forever.<br><br>

                Yesterday's happiness is today's memory, <br>
                And today's pain is not you enemy.<br>
                It is a reflection of the things lost,<br>
                Of which tears are the cost.<br><br>

                We are all artists,<br>
                In our imaginative cysts, <br>
                In a world of broken dreams,<br>
                And no light beams.<br><br>

                Inside our world is certainly dark,<br>
                But dark is where new life starts,<br>
                From dark, in search of light, is the nature of life,<br>
                Only to end in darkness again.<br><br>

                A million feelings, a thousand memories, <br>
                In one heart, that ends with just one heartbeat,<br>
                Life ceases to exist but memories last forever.<br>
                Something short-term, leaving behind marks forever.<br><br>

                Pain, like life, leaves stains,<br>
                An attempt to escape creates greater pain.<br>
                Facing it, the calmness for the next one is what you gain.<br>
                Again, today's pain is tomorrow's power.<br><br>

                There is beauty in the disdain,<br>
                There is beauty in pain,<br>
                For what is real is beautiful, <br>
                It's human to feel.<br>
            </p>
