            <h1>Yet</h1>
            <p><br>On sunlit afternoons,<br>
                With a plethora of emotions, like a typhoon,<br>
                Sneaking into each other's childhoods<br>
                Spilling each other's secrets.<br><br>

                You filled the crevices of my heart, <br>
                And that was the start.<br>
                You counted my heartbeats,<br>
                And tuned yours to my Frequency.<br><br>

                Sometimes I wonder, were love and time once lovers?<br>
                Who broke apart and never recovered?<br>
                For time to love keeps running out<br>
                And love seems to not care for time,<br>
                Stretching it to eternity in a single night.<br>
                Sometimes love exists but the time for it is just not right.<br>
                Sometimes we have all the time in the world but no one to love, <br>
                Sometimes we have no one to love, but a heat full of love.<br><br>

                Late, late at night, <br>
                You would talk expanding time, <br>
                Hoping that it would last forever, <br>
                But time conspired to end, for it to move forward.<br><br>

                I realised that there is no co-relation <br>
                Between eternity and time.<br>
                For forever isn't a count of time,<br>
                Its a moment carrying a dream of a lifetime.<br><br>

                When you stay up late,<br>
                Too scared to dream,<br>
                Time treads anticipating our fate.<br>
                Hoping destiny belongs to us, mate.<br><br>

                The future we dream of together, <br>
                Building it piece by piece for one another, <br>
                I know we are different, like summer and winter, <br>
                But incapable of exisiting without each other. <br><br>
