                <h2>Run down Memorylane</h2>
                <p>I walk down memorylane,<br>
                    Relive the moments again,<br>
                    ‘cause that’s all that remains.<br>
                    At least it soothes the pain,<br>
                    To know that you exist in my heart,<br>
                    And to infinity be a part,<br>
                    Till I depart.<br>
                    So, I walk down memorylane,<br>
                    ‘cause that’s all the remains.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-content">
                <p>Laughing at your bad jokes,<br>
                    Befriending your folks,<br>
                    Finding fault in all your art,<br>
                    And fighting only to agree that you were smart.<br>
                    Ignoring all your faults,<br>
                    Because to me, even if true, were all false.<br>
                    Smiling at all your buffs,<br>
                    ‘cause I believed you were tough.<br>
                    ‘cause I believed in your love.<br>
                    But destiny is arranged above.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-content">
                <p>And I was failed,<br>
                    For I had my heart jailed,<br>
                    And in vain I wailed,<br>
                    Cause these memories were all that remained.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-content">
                <p>When I walk down memorylane,<br>
                    From dancing in your room,<br>
                    To designing our wedding costumes,<br>
                    I was left to doom,<br>
                    To accompany you to your tomb.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-content">
                <p>So, I walk down memorylane,<br>
                    Reliving the moments again,<br>
                    ‘cause that’s all that remains.</p>
